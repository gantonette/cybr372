Part 4: Designing for changes in recommended key length and algorithms

this part of the assignment is to encipher and decipher files using different algorithms and key lengths.
it provides methods to encrypt (enc), decrypt (dec) and print file info (info).

the main method reads arguments from the command line and determines what action to take.
if the first argument is "enc", it reads the following arguments as the algorithm, key length, password, input file, and output file.
it then calls the enc method. if the first argument is "dec", it reads the following arguments as the password, input file, and output file
and then calls the dec method. if the first argument is "info", it reads the input file and calls the printInfo method.

ENCRYPTION:
this method encrypts a file using a specified algorithm and key length.
it generates a salt, derives a key from the provided password using PBKDF2 with Hmac SHA256,
initialises a cipher in encrypt mode with the derived key, and then writes the encrypted file.

it also writes some metadata (algorithm, salt, and iv) to the beginning of the file and some metadata (algorithm and key length)
to the file's attributes (if supported by the file system).

if any exceptions are encountered, they're caught and logged, and the method prints to stdout the base64 encoding of the secret key.

DECRYPTION:
the dec method reverses what the enc method does. it reads the metadata from the encrypted file, derives the key using
the same method as in enc, initialises a cipher in decrypt mode using the derived key and the read metadata, and writes
the decrypted data to a new file.

if any exceptions are encountered, they're caught and logged, and the method lets the user know that the decryption is complete and where they can find the decrypted file.

printInfo:
the printInfo prints out the algorithm and the key length used for the encryption.

USAGE:
(1) Compile: javac FileEncryptor.java
(2) Enc: java FileEncryptor.java mode (enc or dec) algorithm (AES or Blowfish) keylength password inputFile (e.g: plaintext.txt) outputFile (ciphertext.enc)
    java FileEncryptor.java enc Blowfish 128 mypassword plaintext.txt ciphertext.enc
(3) Dec: java FileEncryptor.java mode (dec) password (same password used for encryption) outputFile (e.g: ciphertext.enc) inputfile (e.g: plaintext.txt)
    java FileEncryptor.java dec mypassword ciphertext.enc plaintext.txt
(4) info: java FileEncryptor.java info outputFile (ciphertext.enc)
    java FileEncryptor.java info ciphertext.enc
