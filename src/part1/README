FileEncryptor PART 1

The FileEncryptor is a simple Java command-line utility for encrypting and decrypting files using the AES
(Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) and PKCS5 Padding.

Usage:

    For encryption: java FileEncryptor.java enc inputFile outputFile
    For decryption: java FileEncryptor.java dec key iv inputFile outputFile

Note:
    The input and output file paths should be relative or absolute file paths.
    The key and iv to be used for decryption should be in base64 format and is obtained from the encryption process.

Utility Overview:
    The utility uses a SecureRandom generator to generate random keys and initialisation vector (IV) for the encryption process.
    The key and IV are printed out in both Hex and Base64 encoded formats.
    The utility supports decryption, but you need to supply the base64 encoded key and IV which were produced during the encryption process.
    The utility uses a 128-bit key and IV (16 bytes) for the AES algorithm.
    Upon completion, the utility prints out the file path where the encrypted or decrypted output file is located.

Error:
    If the correct number of arguments are not provided
    If the mode provided is not 'enc' or 'dec'
    If the key and IV are not provided for decryption
